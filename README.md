Pathfinding is an extremely common problem in video game programming. It’s why we are asking you tocreate one for the ghosts in Pacman, with the help of the Dijkstra algorithm.You will illustrate the algorithm and note its distance from the ghost in each visited square.

./304pacman file c1 c2

file    file describing the board, using the following characters:

- ‘0’ for an empty square,

- ‘1’ for a wall,

- ‘F’ for the ghost’s position,

- ‘P’ for Pacman’s position.

c1      character to display for a wall
